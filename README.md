# Welcome to Flow-IPC

This site is bare-bones in terms of content and aesthetics, but we are working on it.  That said we will at least host the most up-to-date documentation for the Flow-IPC project here.

## Where to begin?

The project lives in the `Flow-IPC` organization at GitHub.  You can obtain it either via Git checkout or by grabbing a release tarball.  To get your bearings as to the nature of the project please see the main repository, named `ipc`.

[This README is a good start.](https://github.com/Flow-IPC/ipc/blob/main/README.md)

## Documentation

READMEs aside, the API documentation is generated directly from the source code automatically and is hosted both:
  - inside the checked-out repository `ipc` in the `doc/ipc_doc/` directory (for the self-contained general-purpose library Flow - which the rest of Flow-IPC uses - see `flow` repo `doc/flow_doc/` directory);
  - online at this web site.

Both sets of documentation (in-repo and online) are generated/deployed automatically using GitHub automation:
  - when the `main` branch is updated;
  - when the `main` branch is tagged to mark a new release.

Here is the online documentation for your immediate perusal.
